# Research

This folder collects inspiration and reference material that may inform future features or branding for DaRoutes.

- `images/` stores mockups, AI concepts, and visual assets.
- `text/` holds notes, transcripts, and write-ups gathered during research.

Move any asset that should ship with the app into `public/` instead of keeping it here.
